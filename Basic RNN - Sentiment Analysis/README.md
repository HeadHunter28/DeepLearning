## Sentiment analysis on iMDB reviews using an RNN

### <u>Objective</u> : Build a recurrent neural network for classifying iMDB reviews as Positive/Negative (binary classification)

 1. Doing basic NLP preprocessing on the data loaded from Keras library

 2. Making an Embedding layer to feed the data to the RNN

 3. Implementing different neural networks with varying parameters for better performance. 

! Good basic reference for dealing with text data.
